# docs-evidence-pack

This repo is a public portfolio showing my approach to content design and technical documentation.

## Structure
- `gds-case/` — GOV.UK-style content design case study (user needs → content decisions → outcomes).
- `api-docs/` — Docs-as-code demo with an OpenAPI spec and getting-started tutorial.

## Quick Tasks
1. **GDS case**: fill in `gds-case/index.md` (before/after, user needs, analytics plan, accessibility checklist).
2. **API docs**: edit `api-docs/openapi.yaml` (add fields/endpoints you want to showcase).
3. Commit with messages in the format: `feat(gds): draft before-after` or `feat(api): initial openapi spec`.

## Next Steps
- Turn on GitHub Pages (later) for a simple site, or wire up MkDocs when ready.
- Link this repo in your applications.
