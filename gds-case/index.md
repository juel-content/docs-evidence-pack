# GDS Case Study (Draft)

## Healthcare project – Diabetes medication guidance
I redesigned guidance for type 2 diabetes medication. The original material was dense, jargon-heavy, and hard to scan. Users struggled to find key information quickly.
I mapped the user journey from diagnosis to treatment, grouped related steps into a clear hierarchy, and rewrote content in plain English. I applied GOV.UK style and accessibility principles, breaking long text into headings, bullet points, and step-by-step instructions.

## Before → After:
**Before:** long paragraphs, clinical terms, no clear navigation.

**After:**  tabbed navigation (overview, medication, education), scannable lists, plain-English labels, and repeated access points for key content.

**Impact:**
Easier for time-poor users to scan and act.
Reduced risk of misinterpretation.
Framework colleagues could reuse for other healthcare guidance.

## User needs → Content decisions
- Need 1 → Decision (pattern, microcopy, structure) → Why it helps.
- Need 2 → Decision → Why.
- Need 3 → Decision → Why.

## Evidence
- Analytics or logs (what was the problem and how you knew).
- User quotes or usability notes (optional but ideal).

## Accessibility checklist
- Headings hierarchy, link text, alt text, focus order, colour contrast.
- Readability check score (Flesch/Hemingway or similar).

## Measures of success
- Completion rate ↑ / support tickets ↓ / time on task ↓ / comprehension ↑.
- What you’ll track post‑launch and how often.

## Stakeholder comms
- Artefacts used to explain changes (before/after, readability score, user quotes).
- Objections and how you addressed them.
