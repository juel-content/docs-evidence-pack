# GDS Case Study (Draft)

## Healthcare project – Diabetes medication guidance
I redesigned guidance for type 2 diabetes medication. The original material was dense, jargon-heavy, and hard to scan. Users struggled to find key information quickly.
I mapped the user journey from diagnosis to treatment, grouped related steps into a clear hierarchy, and rewrote content in plain English. I applied GOV.UK style and accessibility principles, breaking long text into headings, bullet points, and step-by-step instructions.

## Before → After:
**Before:** long paragraphs, clinical terms, no clear navigation.

**After:**  tabbed navigation (overview, medication, education), scannable lists, plain-English labels, and repeated access points for key content.

**Impact:**
Easier for time-poor users to scan and act.
Reduced risk of misinterpretation.
Framework colleagues could reuse for other healthcare guidance.

## User needs → Content decisions
- Need 1 → Decision (pattern, microcopy, structure) → Why it helps.
- Need 2 → Decision → Why.
- Need 3 → Decision → Why.

## Evidence
- Analytics or logs (what was the problem and how you knew).
- User quotes or usability notes (optional but ideal).

## Accessibility checklist
- Headings: clear hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3), short and descriptive.
- Link text: meaningful (“Show options”, “Hide options”), no “click here”.
- Lists: used for steps and conditions to support screen readers.
- Plain English: medical jargon replaced with user-friendly terms where safe.
- Layout: tabbed navigation helps users know where they are.
- Repetition: key warnings repeated in context for safety.
- Readability: tested with Hemingway/Flesch – improved from difficult to plain English.
- Colour and contrast: ensured compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA.

## Measures of success
- Comprehension: clearer plain-English content reduces risk of misinterpretation.
- Efficiency: step-by-step format allows time-poor users to scan and act faster.
- Support demand: fewer clarifying questions expected for call handlers and clinicians.
- Consistency: taxonomy and navigation provide a framework reusable across other health content.
- Accessibility: content tested for readability, WCAG compliance, and user feedback.

## Stakeholder comms
- Artefacts used to explain changes (before/after, readability score, user quotes).
- Objections and how you addressed them.
