# GDS Case Study â€“ Healthcare Guidance

This case study shows how I redesigned diabetes medication guidance to make it clearer, safer, and easier to use.  
The original content was dense, jargon-heavy, and hard to scan. Users struggled to find key information quickly.

## What I did
- Scoped the content project from discovery to testing.  
- Mapped the user journey from diagnosis to treatment.  
- Created a taxonomy and structured content types.  
- Rewrote material in plain English using the GOV.UK style guide.  
- Added headings, bullet points, and step-by-step instructions.  

## Before and after
- **Before:** Long paragraphs, clinical terms, no clear navigation.  
- **After:** Tabbed navigation (overview, medication, education), scannable lists, plain-English labels, repeated access points for key content.  

## Impact
- Easier for time-poor users to scan and act.  
- Reduced risk of misinterpretation.  
- Provided a reusable framework for colleagues delivering healthcare content.
