# GDS Case Study (Draft)

## Summary (2–3 sentences)
What service/page, who for, and the user need.

## Before → After (Plain English)
- **Before:** paste a short real snippet that was complex or risky.
- **After:** your rewritten GOV.UK-style version (short sentences, informative headings, active voice).

## User needs → Content decisions
- Need 1 → Decision (pattern, microcopy, structure) → Why it helps.
- Need 2 → Decision → Why.
- Need 3 → Decision → Why.

## Evidence
- Analytics or logs (what was the problem and how you knew).
- User quotes or usability notes (optional but ideal).

## Accessibility checklist
- Headings hierarchy, link text, alt text, focus order, colour contrast.
- Readability check score (Flesch/Hemingway or similar).

## Measures of success
- Completion rate ↑ / support tickets ↓ / time on task ↓ / comprehension ↑.
- What you’ll track post‑launch and how often.

## Stakeholder comms
- Artefacts used to explain changes (before/after, readability score, user quotes).
- Objections and how you addressed them.
